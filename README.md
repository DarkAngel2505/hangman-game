# Hangman Game with Tkinter

A classic Hangman game built with Python and Tkinter, featuring a graphical interface, score tracking, and a custom-drawn hangman figure. This project demonstrates my skills in GUI development, event handling, and game logic.

## Features
- Interactive GUI with letter buttons and keyboard input.
- Custom word list themed around hobbies (e.g., GUITAR, PAINTING).
- Graphical hangman drawn on a Tkinter canvas.
- Score system rewarding correct guesses and wins.
